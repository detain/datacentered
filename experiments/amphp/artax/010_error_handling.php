/**
 * A non-200 response DOES NOT represent an error. A response promise returned from
 * Amp\Artax\Client::request() will only resolve as a failure if something goes seriously wrong with
 * the request/response cycle:
 *
 *     - infinite redirect loop
 *     - invalid/unparsable HTTP response message received from server
 *     - DNS resolution failure
 *     - premature loss of socket connection
 *     - malformed request URI
 *     - etc.
 *
 * All successful responses are modeled as an Amp\Artax\Response and this result is used to resolve
 * the promise result. Status codes are accessible via the standard Amp\Artax\Response::getStatus()
 * method. These should be consulted to determine the success or failure of completed responses.
